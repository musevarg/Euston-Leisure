Program can be run using ELM.exe

Messages in JSON format can be found in file messages.json.
Every message entered in the program updates the file and GUI accordingly.
If file messages.json does not exist, it creates it.

When entering messages manually, invalid messages always return an error message.

Files messages1.csv, messages2.csv, messages3.csv and rubbish.csv contain data to test the software when inputting messages from a file rather than from the input form.

When using a file, the number of invalid messages found in the file are shown to the user at the end of processing.
